Music Genre Classification Using GTZAN Dataset

Overview

This project predicts the genre of a song using precomputed audio features from the GTZAN dataset.

It applies machine learning techniques to classify songs into genres and visualize their feature clusters.

Dataset

File used: features_30_sec.csv

Features include:

Chroma, RMS, Spectral centroid, Bandwidth, Rolloff Zero-crossing rate, Tempo MFCCs (20 coefficients, mean + variance)

Label: label (genre of the song)

Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing

Loaded audio features and genre labels

Split data into training and test sets

Model Training

Used a Random Forest Classifier (100 estimators)

Evaluation

Accuracy score

Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)

Confusion matrix heatmap

Enhancements

PCA visualization of genre clusters

Similarity-based song recommendations using cosine similarity

Results/Findings

Random Forest achieved high accuracy on test data

Confusion matrix reveals which genres are most difficult to distinguish

PCA visualization shows how genres cluster by audio features

Example Outputs

Confusion Matrix Heatmap

PCA plot of genres

Most similar songs (recommendation system)

Future Improvements

Experiment with different models (SVM, Gradient Boosting, Neural Nets)

Extend to deep learning (CNN on raw audio spectrograms)

Build an interactive recommendation system

Technologies Used

Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook

How to Run:

Clone/download this repo

Place features_30_sec.csv in the data/ folder

Open the Jupyter Notebook

Run all cells to train the model and view results
